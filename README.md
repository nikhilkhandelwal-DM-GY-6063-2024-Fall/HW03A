# HW03-A

**This is a submission of Homework for Week 3 Part A.**

This repository contains a p5.js sketch that generates a grid pattern of black colored ellipses of different sizes on the canvas. 

Canvas Setup: The canvas is initialized to the full browser window size, and the background is set to a bright yellow (rgb(235, 214, 1)), providing a vivid backdrop for the circular pattern.

Bigger Circles: Larger black circles (ellipse()) with a diameter of 30 pixels are placed in a grid pattern across the canvas, with a spacing of 100 pixels between each circle in both the x and y directions.

Smaller Circles: A secondary grid of smaller black circles (10-pixel diameter) is drawn, offset from the larger circles. These circles are spaced 50 pixels apart, filling the gaps between the larger circles.

Alternate Rows: In alternate rows, larger circles are shifted by 50 pixels both horizontally and vertically to create a staggered effect, adding depth and variety to the pattern.
